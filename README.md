# Analysis-MSHA-Database---Copper-Mining-Accidents-and-Injuries

A python script which will analyze Mine Safety Health Administration (MSHA) database in order to provide insight into Mine Safety Improvements.

## Introduction 

This project was a group project for ME 489: Mine Health and Safety at New Mexico Tech in Socorro, New Mexico during the Spring Semester of 2021. The aim of the project was to understand the accidents and injuries which occured in the US Copper Mining Industry from 2010-2019 in order to provide insight into current causes and trends of accidents. We (Carlha Barreto, Braci Chester, Julienne Mamaita Aboa Essomba) presented this research at New Mexico Tech Student Research Symposium 2021.

## About the Code

The purpose of this code is to analyze Mine Safety Health Administration (MSHA) Data in order to provide visualizations of a given time period and/or mineral commodity in order to understand trends and areas of safety to improve upon.

To utilize the Python Code:

* Install necessary libraries in your python environment of choice
* Download MSHA Data from MSHA.gov for your desired time period (.DBF file format)
* Modify python script for your time period, desired mining commodity, etc
* Run the python code in order to see data analysis, visualizations, etc
